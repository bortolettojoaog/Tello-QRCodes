$ code .
```

<br />

## 🐾 How to Use:

```bash
# NOTE: In case you are testing in a different location from the one used in the project conception, it is necessary to change the main_grid, taking into account your permitted flying area, and also the grid_text.txt file informing the shelf (grid) and the NOFLYZONEs (areas where the drone cannot fly).

# Run the create_grid.py script
$ python create_grid.py

# Run the find_path.py script
$ python find_path.py

# Connect to your drone's WIFI network

# Place the drone in a safe takeoff and trajectory location

# Run the script to start the flight
$ python trajectory.py
```
